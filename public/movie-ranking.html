<h3> Captain Sully </h3>

<P> Chesley Burnett "Sully" Sullenberger (born January 23, 1951) is a retired American fighter pilot, 
    diplomat, and airline pilot best known for his heroism as captain of US Airways Flight 1549 that 
    he ditched in the Hudson River in 2009 after both engines were disabled by a bird strike. 
    All 155 people aboard survived. Sullenberger became an outspoken advocate for aviation safety 
    and has helped develop new protocols for airline safety. He served as the co-chairman, along with his 
    co-pilot on Flight 1549, Jeffrey Skiles, of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s 
    Young Eagles youth introduction-to-aviation program from 2009 to 2013. </P>

<h3> Runway 34 </h3>

<p> Captain Vikrant Khanna is an accomplished pilot, who is preparing for a flight from Dubai to Cochin. 
    He drinks alcohol and parties the night before the flight, and feels tired on boarding it, 
    where his co-pilot is Tanya Albuquerque. Later, a cyclone in Cochin leads to the flight being
    diverted to Trivandrum on Khanna's suggestion, despite objection from Albuquerque. 
    Albuquerque says that Bengaluru has to be the second option, not Trivandrum, as the latter is 
    near Cochin and has a high chance of having bad weather too. Khanna says that if they divert to 
    Trivandrum, they can attempt a landing there and save fuel. Due to miscommunication, the pilots do not 
    realize that Trivandrum is facing weather worse than Cochin, which reduces the visibility level. 
    Captain Khanna somehow manages to land the flight while closing his eyes, and averts a major disaster. </p>

<h3> Top Gun </h3>
